- Do not generate flashcards for subjective advice, social theories, or "soft topics" (such as productivity tips or book recommendations) that cannot be scientifically verified.
- Do not create flashcards for specific historical topics, monuments, or narratives unless explicitly requested, as the user considers this information general context rather than material for long-term memorization.
- Do not generate flashcards for fundamental computer science concepts or general theoretical justifications (like the logic behind zero-based indexing) that lack deep, concrete technical specifics.
- Do not create flashcards that focus on rote memorization of isolated facts, such as specific dates, names of founders, etymologies, or simple definitions.
- Do not create flashcards for definitions, mechanics, or concepts related to specific financial terms (like LOC), as the user seeks immediate explanation rather than long-term memorization of this domain knowledge.
- Do not create flashcards for specific syntax rules of configuration formats (like TOML, JSON, or YAML) or one-off troubleshooting of syntax errors caused by typos, as this information is better looked up than memorized.

- Do not create flashcards regarding standard programming language syntax, built-in library mechanics, or specific exception types (e.g., Python Enum instantiation errors), as these details are considered too granular and trivial to memorize.
